## 🚀 1. What is Amazon SageMaker?

**Answer:**
Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly and at scale.

---

## 🛠️ 2. What are the main components of SageMaker?

**Answer:**
- **Studio:** Integrated development environment (IDE) for ML
- **Notebook Instances:** Managed Jupyter notebooks
- **Training Jobs:** Scalable training with built-in algorithms or custom code
- **Inference:** Real-time and batch prediction endpoints
- **Model Registry:** Track model versions and deployments
- **Pipelines:** MLOps orchestration for CI/CD

---

## 📦 3. What is SageMaker Autopilot?

**Answer:**
Autopilot automates the machine learning pipeline:
- Automatically preprocesses data
- Trains multiple models
- Provides explainability and deploys best model

---

## ⚙️ 4. How do you train a model in SageMaker?

**Answer:**
- Use built-in algorithms, pre-built Docker containers, or bring your own container
- Define training script and parameters
- Submit a `TrainingJob` using the SDK or console

---

## 🔍 5. What is the difference between batch transform and real-time inference?

**Answer:**
- **Batch Transform:** Asynchronous, used for large datasets
- **Real-Time Inference:** Deployed as HTTPS endpoint for low-latency predictions

---

## 🔁 6. How does SageMaker handle versioning and model registry?

**Answer:**
- Models are registered in **SageMaker Model Registry**
- Track versions, deployment status, metrics, approval status

---

## 🔐 7. How is security managed in SageMaker?

**Answer:**
- IAM roles for fine-grained access control
- Data encryption using AWS KMS
- VPC endpoints for private communication
- SageMaker supports compliance (HIPAA, SOC, etc.)

---

## 📈 8. How can you monitor a deployed model?

**Answer:**
- Enable **Model Monitor** to capture and analyze input/output
- Detect **data drift** and **bias**
- Logs are sent to CloudWatch

---

## 🧪 9. What are SageMaker Experiments?

**Answer:**
Tracks:
- Training runs
- Parameters
- Metrics
- Artifacts
Useful for reproducibility and comparison of different model versions.

---

## 📦 10. What is SageMaker Pipelines?

**Answer:**
Fully managed CI/CD service for ML:
- Define steps like processing, training, evaluation, deployment
- Versioned and integrated with SageMaker Studio and Model Registry

---

## 🧠 11. Can SageMaker work with other AWS services?

**Answer:**
Yes. It integrates with:
- S3 (data storage)
- CloudWatch (monitoring/logging)
- Lambda (automation)
- Step Functions (orchestration)
- Athena/Glue/Redshift (data sources)

---

## 🧪 12. What are the deployment options in SageMaker?

**Answer:**
- **Hosted Endpoint:** Real-time predictions
- **Batch Transform:** Bulk asynchronous inference
- **Edge Deployment:** SageMaker Neo for IoT and edge devices
