# Classification in Machine Learning — Professional Q&A

---

## Q1: What is classification in machine learning?

**A:**  
Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a **category or class label** for a given input. The model is trained on labeled data, where each input is assigned to one of two or more classes.

**Examples:**  
- Email spam detection (spam or not spam)
- Disease diagnosis (positive/negative)
- Handwritten digit recognition (0–9)

## Q2: What are the main types of classification problems?

| Type                   | Description                      | Example                   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Binary Classification  | 2 possible classes               | Spam vs. Not Spam         |
| Multi-class            | >2 possible classes              | Digit recognition (0–9)   |
| Multi-label            | Assign multiple classes per input| Tagging photos with objects|

## Q3: Common classification algorithms

- **Logistic Regression:** For binary and multi-class
- **Decision Trees & Random Forests:** Handle nonlinear data well
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):** Simple, non-parametric
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Good for margin-based classification
- **Naive Bayes:** Probabilistic, often used for text
- **Neural Networks (MLP, CNN, RNN):** For complex or unstructured data

## Q4: How do you evaluate classification models?

| Metric          | Description                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy        | Correct predictions / total samples         |
| Precision       | True positives / predicted positives        |
| Recall          | True positives / actual positives           |
| F1 Score        | Harmonic mean of precision and recall       |
| ROC-AUC         | Probability the model ranks a random positive higher than a negative |

## Q5: What are challenges in classification?

- **Imbalanced data:** Some classes have many more samples (can bias model)
- **Overfitting:** Model may memorize instead of generalize
- **High-dimensional data:** Too many features (curse of dimensionality)
- **Noisy or mislabeled data:** Can hurt accuracy

## Q6: What does classification look like in code (scikit-learn example)?

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = model.predict(X_test)
```
